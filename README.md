I'm Patricia, a passionate web developer currently honing my skills through a comprehensive program at DCI. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've expanded my expertise to include modern tools and frameworks such as TailwindCSS, Sass, React, and TypeScript. My backend proficiency spans MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS, enabling me to build robust and scalable applications.

I'm diving deep into Next.js, Angular, and Nuxt.js, exploring their capabilities to enhance my projects further. Excited about the possibilities they offer, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development.

### ðŸš€ Looking ahead
